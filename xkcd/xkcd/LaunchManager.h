//  LaunchHandling: a protocol that a LaunchHelper subclass should conform to. A class conforming to LaunchHandling
//  is contracted to process a launchObject (any object that can be passed in the launchOptions dictionary in
//  application:didFinishLaunchWithOptions, e.g. NSUserActivity, UIApplicationShortcutItem) and return a
//  merchantLocationUuid.
//
//  LaunchHelper: a superclass that a LaunchHandling class should extend. A LaunchHelper subclass gains the
//  ability to handle a launchObject (defined above) in a generic way. Calling handleLaunchObject on a subclass
//  resets the window and posts a ShowMerchantView notification with userInfo containing the merchantLocationUuid
//  dealt by the protocol. Any specific soft-launch application delegate methods (e.g.
//  application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:) should call handleLaunchObject on its corresponding
//  LaunchHelper subclass.
