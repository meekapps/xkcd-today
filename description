I do not write xkcd. My name is Keller. I made this app to have a nice way to read the comic on an iPhone and to check out the latest comic as a notifications center today view widget.

Other neat features/reasons you might want to download this app:
-There is offline viewing.
-You can store Favorites.
-There's a Today View widget.
-There are 3d touch home screen shortcuts.
-You can search in Spotlight.
-It supports Portrait or Landscape modes.
-It CAN ZOOM.
-It's open-source.
